The CSV files report the performance of the OCEANIA controller when operating over DCN topologies of different size, as reported in the following table:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
| Scenario       | 2 pods | 3 pods | 4 pods | 5 pods | 6 pods |
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
| # POD switches |    2   |   3    |   4    |   5    |    6   |
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
| # planes       |    2   |   2    |   2    |   2    |    2   |
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
| # ToRs per POD |   80   |   80   |   80   |   80   |    80  |
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
| # DCN nodes    |  164   |  246   |  328   |  410   |   492  |
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each test has been executed sending a request for a new DCN path every 7.5 seconds, for a total duration of 30 minutes (240 requests in total).

List of CSV files:
- 2P_1800_7_5.csv : OCEANIA performance data over a DCN with 2 pods
- 3P_1800_7_5.csv : OCEANIA performance data over a DCN with 3 pods
- 4P_1800_7_5.csv : OCEANIA performance data over a DCN with 4 pods
- 5P_1800_7_5.csv : OCEANIA performance data over a DCN with 5 pods
- 6P_1800_7_5.csv : OCEANIA performance data over a DCN with 6 pods

Each file includes the following parameters:
- total number of occurred errors
- total number of established paths
- average time for path provisioning (i.e. total DCN reconfiguration time when a new path is established)
- maximum time for path provisioning (i.e. total DCN reconfiguration time when a new path is established)
- minimum time for path provisioning (i.e. total DCN reconfiguration time when a new path is established)
- standard deviation of time for path provisioning (i.e. total DCN reconfiguration time when a new path is established)
- total number of computed traffic matrices
- average time for traffic matrix computation (i.e. time required to build the new traffic matrix with the requested path)
- maximum time for traffic matrix computation (i.e. time required to build the new traffic matrix with the requested path)
- minimum time for traffic matrix computation (i.e. time required to build the new traffic matrix with the requested path)
- standard deviation of time for traffic matrix computation (i.e. time required to build the new traffic matrix with the requested path)
- total number of computed network allocation solutions
- average time for computation of a DCN allocation solution
- maximum time for computation of a DCN allocation solution
- minimum time for computation of a DCN allocation solution
- standard deviation of time for computation of a DCN allocation solution
- total number of network allocation solution -> OF rules translations
- average time to translate between a network allocation solution and the related OF rules
- maximum time to translate between a network allocation solution and the related OF rules
- minimum time to translate between a network allocation solution and the related OF rules
- standard deviation of time to translate between a network allocation solution and the related OF rules
- total number of DCN reconfigurations via OpenFlow messages
- average time for DCN reconfiguration via OpenFlow messages (i.e. time required to forward the OF messages to the node agents)
- maximum time for DCN reconfiguration via OpenFlow messages (i.e. time required to forward the OF messages to the node agents)
- minimum time for DCN reconfiguration via OpenFlow messages (i.e. time required to forward the OF messages to the node agents)
